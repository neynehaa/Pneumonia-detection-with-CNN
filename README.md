# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection Using X-Rays

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect **pneumonia** from chest X-ray images. The system classifies X-ray images as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia** and provides visual explanations for the predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end pipeline for **pneumonia detection** from X-ray images.
- **Data preprocessing**: resizing, normalization, and train/validation/test splits.
- **CNN model** implemented in PyTorch with configurable hyperparameters.
- **Training monitoring**: accuracy, loss tracking, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling.
- **Model evaluation**: confusion matrix, class-wise metrics, and prediction visualization.
- **Interpretability**: Grad-CAM and feature visualization techniques.
- **Deployment-ready**: save/load models and perform inference on new images.
- Performance optimization via **hyperparameter tuning** and architecture variations.
